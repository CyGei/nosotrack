      "<strong>Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)</strong> affect approximately 1 in 10 patients worldwide, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic strain on healthcare systems. <strong>Nosocomial outbreaks</strong> driven by person-to-person transmitted pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and MRSA generate the most acute clinical and operational crises: triggering staff shortages, ward closures, and delayed procedures. Current control measures rely on broad testing and isolation protocols, but <strong>effective intervention requires identifying the specific drivers of an outbreak</strong>: such as patient zero, superspreaders, transmission routes, and undetected or imported cases.",
      "<span class=\"nosotrack-highlight\">NosoTrack</span> <strong>is an outbreak analytics platform that infers who infected whom in near real-time</strong> by integrating data from hospital Electronic Health Records with Bluetooth enabled contact tracing. It delivers early warnings and actionable reports, enabling hospital infection prevention teams to target interventions promptly before an outbreak escalates."
