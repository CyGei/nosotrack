      "<strong>Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)</strong> affect approximately 1 in 10 patients worldwide, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic strain on healthcare systems. <strong>Nosocomial outbreaks</strong> driven by person-to-person transmitted pathogens such as <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>, <strong>Clostridioides difficile</strong>, <strong>Klebsiella pneumoniae</strong>, and <strong>MRSA</strong> generate the most acute clinical and operational crises: triggering staff shortages, ward closures, and delayed procedures. Current control measures rely on broad testing and isolation protocols, but <strong>effective intervention requires identifying the specific drivers of an outbreak</strong>: such as patient zero, superspreaders, transmission routes, and undetected or imported cases.",

These methods have been applied to real outbreak data, including SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks in Switzerland, MRSA in neonatal intensive care units in the UK, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> in a Nepali neonatal unit, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> in hospitals in North Carolina, and Ebola outbreaks in the DRC. We are committed to open science, with all software freely available and publications accessible to the public.",
